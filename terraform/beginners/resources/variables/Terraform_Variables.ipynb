    "# Input Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Input variables make your Terraform configuration more flexible by defining values that your end users can assign to customize the configuration. They provide a consistent interface to change how a given configuration behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike variables found in programming languages, Terraform's input variables don't change values during a Terraform run such as plan, apply, or destroy. Instead, they allow users to more safely customize their infrastructure by assigning different values to the variables before execution begins, rather than editing configuration files manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use Terraform to deploy a web application on AWS. The supporting infrastructure includes a VPC, load balancer, and EC2 instances. You will parameterize this configuration with Terraform input variables. Finally, you will interpolate variables into strings, use variables with functions, and use variable validation.\n",

    "This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the Terraform workflow. If you are new to Terraform, complete the Get Started collection first.\n",
